# Resource Selection

Use the least disruptive source that can complete the task:

1. Current conversation context and local project files.
2. Direct web pages, public APIs, and raw documentation URLs.
3. Text-only search when the exact page is unknown.
4. Managed Playwright for rendered pages and browser actions.
5. A visible Playwright window when a person must log in.

## Browser Policy

Playwright is the project's only browser backend. Task execution uses explicit
`headless` or `virtual-display` mode for browsing, uploads, generation, downloads,
and verification. A separate visible window serves human login only.
Use the managed `cuddly-winner-browser` tools for browser actions.

### Shared settings

The MCP and login helper read `<config_dir>/cuddly-winner-browser.json`:

```json
{
  "channel": "chrome",
  "executionMode": "virtual-display",
  "automationCompatibility": true
}
```

`channel` accepts `default`, `chromium` (full Chromium), or `chrome` (installed
Google Chrome). `executionMode` defaults to `headless`; `automationCompatibility`
defaults to false. When enabled, compatibility mode omits `--enable-automation`
and adds `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` for both login and task
browsers. It adds no JavaScript webdriver override or user-agent spoofing.

The settings file takes precedence over inherited environment values. Without
it, `CUDDLY_WINNER_BROWSER_CHANNEL`, `CUDDLY_WINNER_BROWSER_EXECUTION_MODE`, and
`CUDDLY_WINNER_BROWSER_AUTOMATION_COMPATIBILITY=true|false` supply these settings.
Malformed settings fail before launch. Both task modes use a 1280x1024 viewport.

Install through the existing managed-profile installer:

```sh
bash scripts/deploy-opencode-agents.sh install --config-dir "$HOME/.config/opencode"
```

The installer preserves the shared settings file. Restart OpenCode after changes
to runtime files, settings, or agent instructions. MCP configuration reports
`configured`; `browser_status` reports the selected execution mode, applied launch
options, browser version, virtual display, and page health.

### Virtual-display execution

On Debian-based Linux, install `xvfb` and `xauth`. The managed MCP launches itself
through `xvfb-run --auto-servernum` on an isolated 1280x1024x24 screen with TCP
disabled, then starts headed Chrome/Chromium. Each service owns its display.
EOF and termination close the browser and display. Missing dependencies fail
without using the physical desktop or switching modes.

Xvfb and compatibility settings do not guarantee site access. Never switch modes
or retry a denied request automatically. Human login still opens on the person's
physical desktop, not inside the task display.

## Browser Actions And Login

1. Try the requested action in the task browser, reusing approved state for the
   target origin first. A sign-in link alone does not prove login is required.
2. If login is required, name the site and obtain approval for headed Playwright.
3. Start the visible window, ask the user to log in, leave it open, and reply.
   End the turn. Do not poll, guess a completion selector, or impose a countdown.
4. After the reply, complete capture and close the login window.
5. Load the saved state in a fresh task context, verify account or requested task
   access, and continue there. Do not complete the task in the login window.

Use the same configuration root and state name for the handoff:

```sh
node "$HOME/.config/opencode/opencode-browser-login.mjs" start --config-dir "$HOME/.config/opencode" --name site --url https://example.com/ --origin https://example.com
# End the turn; capture only after the user's reply:
node "$HOME/.config/opencode/opencode-browser-login.mjs" complete --config-dir "$HOME/.config/opencode" --name site
```

`start` returns `awaiting-user`; its detached worker survives between turns.
`cancel` closes without saving. `pending` is a metadata-only recovery check, not
a polling loop. A second `start` refuses to replace a live worker. Startup and
state reads have bounded operation timeouts; the person has no login deadline.
A closed window cannot be captured or overwrite an existing record.

Report a blocker if the required login has no graphical session, the browser
cannot start, or saved state cannot be reused. Neither capture nor a redirect
proves authentication. A challenge or access denial does not justify new login.

## Login State

Saved state belongs outside repositories, with mode-0600 files under
`<config_dir>/cuddly-winner-sessions/`. Each record is scoped to approved HTTPS
origins and a site/account name. Never use a personal everyday browser profile.
Use ephemeral contexts by default; persistent login state is opt-in saved state,
not a continuously running browser profile. Removal affects only the named record.

Capture reads cookies and local storage from existing approved-origin tabs,
including popups. It never calls `context.storageState()` in the visible login
context or opens synthetic tabs. IndexedDB and closed-tab storage are not
captured. Use `--session-storage` only when the site requires it. Restoration
runs before page scripts and only on the stored origins. Missing or foreign-origin
records are skipped; records without verification metadata cannot authenticate.

New captures store `verification: {"method":"user-confirmed"}`. This authorizes
restoration and inspection, not an authenticated verdict. The agent checks the
actual account UI or task access. Selector-based records require their account
selector before the runtime labels them authenticated. A composer alone is not
proof of login. State values never enter model context, logs, screenshots, or
tool output. Private worker/socket lifecycle details are in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Image Uploads

Use `browser_upload_image` with the user-requested absolute `path` and an observed
visible `ref` or `selector`. The target can be a visible file input or a control
that opens a file chooser. Open an attachment menu first if needed; the upload
tool clicks its chooser control. Never target a hidden fallback input directly.

The tool accepts nonempty regular PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF files, checks their byte
signatures, and rejects symlink leaves and paths inside the private config root.
The default size limit is 20 MiB (`CUDDLY_WINNER_BROWSER_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`). It
returns basename, MIME type, byte count, and SHA-256 after verifying selection.

Record intent before attaching: selection may start a server upload. Inspect
the attachment preview, filename, and site errors before submitting the prompt.
Selection alone is not server acceptance. If the input resets or the operation
times out, inspect the page before retrying. Upload never submits a prompt.

## Downloads And Generated Files

A page result and a local delivery are separate outcomes:

1. Confirm the output belongs to the current request, not an older page item.
2. Use `browser_download` with a visible control's `ref` or `selector`, or its
   `url` option for retrieval through the same authenticated task context.
3. Save without replacing an unrelated file.
4. Validate nonzero size, file type, and required signature, hash, or content.
5. Report success only after page association and local-byte checks pass.

Supply `expected_content_type`, `signature_hex`, and `expected_sha256` when known.
The download action preserves original bytes. When no download control exists,
`browser_save_media` saves visible image/canvas pixels as PNG without exposing
the source URL. It can reject a prior source fingerprint as stale. Neither action
overwrites an existing destination; a page preview is not a delivered file.

For generation, confirm the final prompt before submission, preserve the
conversation address, and associate the new output with that submission.
An existing image is not success.

## Failure Handling And Interrupted Actions

Use short bounded waits that leave the browser usable. Explicit navigation may
recreate a closed page. Treat HTTP 401/403 and Cloudflare challenges as access
denial: report the blocker rather than automatically navigating, recapturing
login, restarting, or changing browser settings to bypass it.

Record intent before sending, publishing, purchasing, or starting generation.
After an interruption, mark the outcome unknown and inspect the original page
before considering a retry. Never repeat an unknown action automatically.
Record only the stage, safe page address, mode, and possible action outcome,
not credentials or page secrets. Stop if output association or local validation
cannot establish success.

## Session Fetch

`session_fetch` serves configured sites when direct public retrieval is not enough.
It uses approved visible login followed by private headless retrieval, returns an
opaque handle, accepts only `GET` and `HEAD` to configured HTTPS origins, and
clears state on close or expiry.
